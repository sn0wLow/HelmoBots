A [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) Plugin for Counter-Strike 2 designed to diversify bot behavior, enhancing their selection of weapons and equipment.  
With this plugin, bots will now choose from a wider array of weaponry including the M4A1-S, MP5-SD, R8 Revolver, etc.  
Additionally, some bots will have the USP-S equipped as default and also purchase defuse kits or armor during Pistol Rounds.
